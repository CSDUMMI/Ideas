# A democratic social network
### Of the users, by the users, and for the users.



## The current social networks aren't fair
The current social networks are mostly top-down,
directed by the search profit and gain.
I think this is bad in that it instrumentalists
the content producers, that mostly do their work
for no immediate gain and profit. And these creators
are totally dependent on the platform and its algorithm,
this isn't fair. Because they will eventually
have to adhere to the goals of the platform, profit and
commercial gain.

## Control to the users
I think the only way we can create a fair network
is to give the control of the algorithm to the sum
of all creators and users. A democratic process.
I would recommend to build three branches as in
a democratic government:
- Judicial
- Executive
- Legislative

## The Legislative branch
This also means that the Legislative branch
institutes "laws" and approves the source code,
that should be open source and even free.

## The Executive branch
The Executive branch should mostly consist
of programmers, that change the source
code in the terms that the Legislative branch
institutes it.

## The Judicial branch
And the Judicial branch should decide about conflicts
between users/creators and, or the government.

## Elections
All users, regardless of age or using time, should
be able to vote.
But they can't vote on every issue in the social network,
they will have to elect Representatives, that are users too.
There should be three major elected offices:
- President
- Parliament
- Lead developer

All offices should be elected for no more than a year.
Though this can be changed, if deemed necessary for
a better performing and government of the network.  
## The Parliament
The Parliament is part of the Legislative branch
and it is the only part of the network that can
decide upon policy, laws and approve upon changes
in the code base. It consists of a fixed number
of members that are elected in a special process.

## Election of members of Parliament
Every user can choose a single candidate
for MP and then the X most often choosen
get to be MPs. The candidates with the highest
number of votes is secretary general of the parliament.
She or he organizes the parliament.

## The President
The President has only one
objective, supervise the parliament and if he or she
disapproves, he or she can call for reelections of the parliament.

## Lead developer
The lead developer is the only office elected
by only a subset of the whole community of the
social network, he or she is elected by the
developers of the network, everybody that participated
in the open development of the network.
The lead developer is responsible for the developing
process and maintainer of the whole code base,
he or she organizes the developers of the social network
and implements features and policies that passed through
the Parliament. He or she is also responsible for
the security of:
1. The democratic process
2. The Representatives
3. The users
In this order.

## How changes to the code base are implemented.
There are to different processes for changes
to be implemented and accepted into the code base.
There are two different kinds of changes:
1. Regular changes
2. Security related changes

## Regular changes
The first kind of changes goes through this process:
1. Policy and feature implementation is passed through parliament
2. Changes at the code base are implemented
3. Changes are approved by Maintainer of the specific part of the code base
4. Changes are approved by the lead developer
5. Changes are approved by parliament
6. Changes go to the running server
All proposed changes must relate to some policy passed
by parliament.

## Security related changes
Changes, which put any user, the democratic process or the Representatives
at risk, are security related. These must have a less public process:
1. Changes are proposed to the lead developer
2. He or she informs the president
3. If both agree, the changes are put onto the public server
4. The security vulnerability and changes are disclosed to the parliament and thus to the public
5. Parliament approves or disapproves the changes afterwards
6. The changes may be removed if the parliament disapproves

# Conclusion
If you want a fair social network,
you need a democratic system to control
yourself and the social network.
